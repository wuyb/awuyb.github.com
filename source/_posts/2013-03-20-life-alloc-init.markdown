It has been more than 16 months since I came back to Beijing - the city that I lived, loved and left. Things haven't changed a lot, except myself. I got my PhD degree, finally, after three-and-a-half-year i-don't-know-what-i-was-doing time. Like a trophy, it looks good on the wall and in the resume, but deep down in my heart, I know it is somewhat a waste of time and energy. I had too many ideas to change the world, or at least to improve people's life in some way. It just passed by because 'I do not have the time because I am a PhD student.'. 

Now I have been back and spent 16 months in trivial and less meaningful things, such as Hukou and immigration application. Life has confused me once again. Is the life now what I want? The answer is absolutely no. What is that I really want? I can't answer definitely. I know, however, I need to do something, make something and realize some of my earlier dreams. Hence, a new project is started.

It is still too early to publish it (I know "lean startup"...) but I have a prototype running. It is never late to learn so design driven development has become my new topic. I love neat designs: the iPhone, Macbook Air etc. I don't know how many readers I will have, but just in case you are one of them and are interested, drop me a line (found my email [here](http://wuyb.com/ "wuyb.com")) please.
